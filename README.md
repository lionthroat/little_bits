# Little Bits
### Desktop task tracker, timer, and notes app

Little Bits was created because I wanted an open source productivity app that functioned totally offline, without the cloud, and put me in control of my data.

Beyond that, the basic idea is not just to make a list, but to combat overwhelm. Sure, you know what you need to do, but how do you get started? Sometimes, there's truly no ideal way to tackle things other than to START. Little Bits will pick a task at random for you, and start 15 minutes on the clock to get going. When the 15 minutes are up, you can ask for more time, indicate that you need to switch to something else for a while, or mark the task as complete. You can also say you need a break, or reject a task assigned to you that you aren't ready for yet! You can also add new tasks, mark a task as done, or delete tasks whenever you want, whether the timer is going or not.

Each calendar day has an entry in the .json datafile, and for each day you can separately store your tasks and notes. Unfinished tasks from the previous day automatically roll over to the next day.

You can switch back and forth between notes at any time, and closing the program will not erase your notes or tasks. Currently, you can only have one note associated with any given date, and rich text formatting is not supported. However, those are things I'd like to develop into more robust features, because I use the notes view every day!
